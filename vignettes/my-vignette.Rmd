## Abstract
In this paper, we propose the heuristic in order to calculate the coordinates in high dimensions, if the similarities or distances between the two points and dimentions in the space are given, this heuristic calculates the approximate coordinates in high dimentions. And if the similarities or distances have a contradict in metric space, the method calculates the approximate coordinates. Its coordinates are available for lots of analysis. This heuristic proposed by R package.

## Introduction
Multi-Dimentional Scaling(MDS)[@Borg2005] is a statistical method in order to find a data structure. If the similarities or distances between the two points are given, MDS can map the data to two or three dimention coordinate space. In this package, I proposed the heuristic in order to calculate coordinates in high dimentional space from the data of similarities or distance between two points. This heuristic calculates the approximate coordinates in the dimension determined by user. And if the similarities or distances have a contradict in metric space, the method calculates the approximate coordinates. And several important methods like Clustering[@Liu2007], Nearest Neighbor Search[@Zezula2006]  and Data Visualization[@Ben2007] require the coordinates in high dimensions as metric space. And this heuristic acts as below.First of all, randomly map the points in the high dimentional space. Then a distance between two points compare with the given data in order. If distance is longer than the data, the disntace is made shorter by moving coordinates. If distance is shorter than the data, the disntance is made longer. This iteration continues until a sum of disntace becomes smaller than approximate rate or a limit of iteration count. As a result, an approximate coordinate points in all data are acquired.

## Installation

```
> install.packages("hmds")
```

If download from Github you can use devtools by the commands:

```
> library(devtools)
> install_github("jirotubuyaki/hmds")

```

Once the packages are installed, it needs to be made accessible to the current R session by the commands:

```
> library(hmds)
```

For online help facilities or the details of a particular command (such as the function hmds) you can type:

```
> help(package="hmds")
> help(hmds)
```
##Method
This pakage has only one method. And it is excused by:

```
> output <- hmds(data = input,dim=20,approx=1.2,itera=10000)
```

Let's args be

* data is a numeric matrix of input data. it describe the distance between two points. 
* dim describe dimentions of distance space between two poitns. 
* approx is approximate rate of difference between input distance and output distanced. If the difference between input and output are shoter than approximate rate, iterations are halt. 
* itera is iteration numbers to search space between all each two points.

Then let's return be

* output is a numeric matrix of points in a distance space. row is items. col is dimentions.

#Conclusions
The heuristic for Multi dimentional Scaling is described and explain how to use. This package can produce the approximate coordinates in high dimentions. And several improvements are planed. Please send suggenstion and report bugs to okadaalgorithm@gmail.com.
